## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works & Technical Details

This extension is built using modern Manifest V3 standards for better security and performance. Here‚Äôs a brief overview 
of the architecture and key APIs:

-   **`manifest.json`**: The core configuration file. It defines permissions (`scripting`, `i18n`), the service worker,
- and UI components.
-   **`popup.html` / `popup.js`**: The UI and main controller for the extension. The `popup.js` script orchestrates the
- entire process, handling user clicks and managing communication between the other scripts.
-   **`content.js`**: This script is programmatically injected into the active web page using 
- `chrome.scripting.executeScript()`. Its job is to extract the article's text content and determine its language
- using the `chrome.i18n.detectLanguage()` API.
-   **`background.js`**: The service worker. It receives text from the popup and performs the summarization.
    -   **Note**: This implementation uses a placeholder/mock summarization function. It can be extended to integrate
    - with a real AI summarization API (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini).
-   **`navigator.language.translate()`**: An **experimental API** that provides access to the browser's built-in 
- translation engine. This allows for seamless, on-device text translation without needing external API keys or services.

### Data Flow:

1.  User clicks **"Summarize Page"** in the popup.
2.  `popup.js` executes `content.js` on the current tab.
3.  `content.js` grabs the page text, detects its language, and sends this data back to `popup.js`.
4.  `popup.js` sends the extracted text to `background.js`.
5.  `background.js` runs its summarization logic and returns the summary to `popup.js`.
6.  `popup.js` displays the summary. If the original language was not English, it also shows the "Translate" button.
7.  If the user clicks "Translate", `popup.js` calls `navigator.language.translate()` to get the translation and 
8. updates the UI.
